        <p>Perception  is a private process for each individual. However, individual differences in  human perception are often considered to be &ldquo;noise&rdquo; and are therefore discarded  through averaging data from a group of participants. 
        Multistable stimuli, such  as Rubin's vase, are useful tools for investigating individual variability of  perceptual organization since they can lead to more than one percept although  sensory inputs are constant. 
        We use combinations of psychophysical,  neuroimaging, and genotyping methods to understand the individuality of perceptual experience, as well as, cognitive abilities and  motor skills. 
        We further examine neural mechanisms of subjectivity beyond individuality.</p>
